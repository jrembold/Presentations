Meteorites or comets of radius approximately 1-100 m are burnt away or dispersed in the atmospheres of the Earth and Venus. However, when such objects strike the Moon they deposit their energy in a small initial volume, forming a plasma plume whose visible and infrared radiation may be visible from the Earth. We consider impacts of model SiO2 projectiles on the surface of an SiO2 model Moon.},

abstract = {Numerically-speaking, the orbits of meteoroids dominate our knowledge of the orbital parameters of Earth-crossing small bodies: the meteoroid orbit database outstrips the numbers of observed Earth-crossing asteroids and comets by over two orders of magnitude. Whilst it is often imagined that small meteoroids are predominantly derived from comets through stream formation, and thus must have comet-like orbits, in fact the majority of observed meteoroid orbits are more similar to those of Apollo and Aten asteroids, with small, low-inclination orbits. In all about 69 000 meteoroid orbits are available from the IAU Meteor Data Center in Lund, Sweden, having been measured in various optical and radar observation programs based in the U.S.A., Canada, the former Soviet Union, Somalia, the Czech Republic, Japan, and Australia. Depending upon the detection method used, the original meteoroids producing the observed meteoric phenomena range in size from ˜100 $\mu$m to ˜10 cm. Here the raw orbital, radiant and speed distributions are presented for the major surveys, a common format being used so that they may be intercompared such that general conclusions may be drawn, and the differences between the survey results identified. These data, collected over the past several decades, provide an important source of information on the origin and evolution of the small bodies in the solar system.},

Most have a chance of approximately 0.5\% of colliding with the Earth in the next million years. The total number of such bodies with diameters > 1 km has been estimated to be in the range 1,000-2,000, which translates to an approximately 1\% chance of a catastrophic collision with the Earth in the next millennium. These numbers are, however, poorly constrained because of the limitations of previous searches using photographic plates. (One kilometre is below the size of a body whose impact on the Earth would produce global effects.) Here we report an analysis of our survey for near-Earth asteroids that uses improved detection technologies. We find that the total number of asteroids with diameters > 1 km is about half the earlier estimates.

abstract = {The orbital and absolute magnitude distribution of the near-Earth objects (NEOs) is difficult to compute, partly because only a modest fraction of the entire NEO population has been discovered so far, but also because the known NEOs are biased by complicated observational selection effects. To circumvent these problems, we created a model NEO population which was fit to known NEOs discovered or accidentally rediscovered by Spacewatch. Our method was to numerically integrate thousands of test particles from five source regions that we believe provide most NEOs to the inner Solar System. Four of these source regions are in or adjacent to the main asteroid belt, while the fifth one is associated with the transneptunian disk. The nearly isotropic comets, which include the Halley-type comets and the long-period comets, were not included in our model. Test bodies from our source regions that passed into the NEO region (perihelia q<1.3 AU and aphelia Q≥0.983 AU) were tracked until they were eliminated by striking the Sun or a planet or were ejected out of the inner Solar System. These integrations were used to create five residence time probability distributions in semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination space (one for each source). These distributions show where NEOs from a given source are statistically most likely to be located. Combining these five residence time probability distributions with an NEO absolute magnitude distribution computed from previous work and a probability function representing the observational biases associated with the Spacewatch NEO survey, we produced an NEO model population that could be fit to 138 NEOs discovered or accidentally rediscovered by Spacewatch. By testing a range of possible source combinations, a best-fit NEO model was computed which (i) provided the debiased orbital and absolute magnitude distributions for the NEO population and (ii) indicated the relative importance of each NEO source region. Our best-fit model is consistent with 960±120 NEOs having H<18 and a<7.4 AU. Approximately 44\% (as of December 2000) have been found so far. The limits on this estimate are conditional, since our model does not include nearly isotropic comets. Nearly isotropic comets are generally restricted to a Tisserand parameter (with respect to Jupiter) of T<2, such that few are believed to have a<7.4 AU. Our computed NEO orbital distribution, which is valid for bodies as faint as H<22, indicates that the Amor, Apollo, and Aten populations contain 32±1\%, 62±1\%, and 6±1\% of the NEO population, respectively. We estimate that the population of objects completely inside Earth's orbit (IEOs) arising from our source regions is 2\% the size of the NEO population. This value does not include the putative Vulcanoid population located inside Mercury's orbit. Overall, our model predicts that ∼61\% of the NEO population comes from the inner main belt (a<2.5 AU), ∼24\% comes from the central main belt (2.5<a<2.8 AU), ∼8\% comes from the outer main belt (a>2.8 AU), and ∼6\% comes from the Jupiter-family comet region (2<T≲3). The steady-state population in each NEO source region, as well as the influx rates needed to replenish each region, were calculated as a by-product of our method. The population of extinct comets in the Jupiter-family comet region was also computed.},

abstract = {Asteroids with diameters smaller than approximately 50-100 m that collide with the Earth usually do not hit the ground as a single body; rather, they detonate in the atmosphere. These small objects can still cause considerable damage, such as occurred near Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908. The flux of small bodies is poorly constrained, however, in part because ground-based observational searches pursue strategies that lead them preferentially to find larger objects. A Tunguska-class event-the energy of which we take to be equivalent to 10 megatons of TNT-was previously estimated to occur every 200-300 years, with the largest annual airburst calculated to be approximately 20 kilotons (kton) TNT equivalent (ref. 4). Here we report satellite records of bolide detonations in the atmosphere over the past 8.5 years. We find that the flux of objects in the 1-10-m size range has the same power-law distribution as bodies with diameters >50 m. From this we estimate that the Earth is hit on average annually by an object with approximately 5 kton equivalent energy, and that Tunguska-like events occur about once every 1,000 years.},

@article{Morbidelli2002,
abstract = {A recently published model of the Near Earth Object (NEO) orbital–magnitude distribution (Bottke et al., 2002, Icarus156, 399–433.) relies on five intermediate sources for the NEO population: the $\nu$6 resonance, the 3:1 resonance, the outer portion of the main belt (i.e., 2.8–3.5 AU), the Mars-crossing population adjacent to the main belt, and the Jupiter family comet population. The model establishes the relative contribution of these sources to the NEO population. By computing the albedo distribution of the bodies in and/or near each of the five sources, we can deduce the albedo distribution of the NEO population as a function of semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination. A problem with this strategy, however, is that we do not know a priori the albedo distribution of main belt asteroids over the same size range as observed NEOs (diameter D<10 km). To overcome this problem, we determined the albedo distribution of large asteroids in and/or near each NEO source region and used these results to deduce the albedo distribution of smaller asteroids in the same regions. This method requires that we make some assumptions about the absolute magnitude distributions of both asteroid families and background asteroids. Our solution was to extrapolate the observed absolute magnitude distributions of the families up to some threshold value Hthr, beyond which we assumed that the families' absolute magnitude distributions were background-like. We found that Hthr=14.5 provides the best match to the color vs heliocentric distance distribution observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. With this value of Hthr our model predicts that the debiased ratio between dark and bright (albedo smaller or larger than 0.089) objects in any absolute-magnitude-limited sample of the NEO population is 0.25±0.02. Once the observational biases are properly taken into account, this agrees very well with the observed C/S ratio (0.165 for H<20). The dark/bright ratio of NEOs increases to 0.87±0.05 if a size-limited sample is considered. We estimate that the total number of NEOs larger than a kilometer is 855±110, which, compared to the total number of NEOs with H<18 (963±120), shows that the usually assumed conversion H=18↞D=1 km slightly overestimates the number of kilometer-size objects. Combining our orbital distribution model with the new albedo distribution model, and assuming that the density of bright and dark bodies is 2.7 and 1.3 g/cm3, respectively, we estimate that the Earth should undergo a 1000 megaton collision every 63,000±8000 years. On average, the bodies capable of producing 1000 megaton of impact energy are those with H<20.6. The NEOs discovered so far carry only 18±2\% of this collision probability.},

abstract = {We present observations of lunar Leonid impact flashes recorded in 2001 November from Spain. Four impact flashes were detected on November 18. Another flash was also recorded on the same night, which appears to be impact related, and two more on that night are possibly, but not unambiguously, of impact nature. On November 19 another flash was detected, which very likely resulted from an impact. The brightest impact flash reached a peak brightness of 5.2 ± 0.3 mag in V ; it had a very dim precursor just 0.02 s prior to peak brightness and had a very long lasting afterglow that remained visible for more than 600 ms with oscillations in brightness; this unique and unexpected behavior challenges current models of impact flashes. The other flashes did not show such a behavior and remained visible for a few tens of milliseconds. Adopting the luminous efficiency derived for the 1999 lunar Leonids (2 × 10 -3 ), our observations can be used to estimate meteoroid fluxes. The observations are compatible with a flux of 0.1 meteoroids of mass larger than 2 × 10 -8 kg km -2 hr -1 on November 18 at 18:15 UT, provided that a mass index of 1.69 is used. Both the flux and the mass index agree with meteor observations carried out in 2001 from several locations on Earth.},

abstract = {Gathering information on the physical characteristics of the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population is important for a number of scientific and technical reasons, including accurate assessment of the impact hazard and considerations of mitigation techniques. Observations in the thermal infrared enable albedos and diameters to be derived and can give some insight into the thermal properties of an object. Albedos are particularly important for resolving ambiguities in the determination of taxonomic types from reflection spectra. Even though about 1800 NEAs have been discovered to date, our knowledge of their sizes and albedos is limited to very few objects, resulting in a large uncertainty on the distribution of these parameters for the whole population. We present a summary of results to date from an ongoing extensive program of thermal-IR observations of near-Earth asteroids using the Keck 1, Mauna Kea, Hawaii and ESO 3.6-m (La Silla, Chile) telescopes. Albedos and diameters are derived by model fitting to spectrophotometry in the 5-20 $\mu$m range and data from optical observations. These obervations are providing information on much smaller (and younger) asteroids than those observed in the main belt and suggest that the albedo distribution of the NEA population may be quite different to that of the observed main-belt population. Relevant aspects of the thermal modelling and the question of the unexpectedly high albedo values obtained in several cases are discussed.},

The number of bodies in the projectile population with diameters of 1 km or more is 700±130, which is in good agreement with recent estimates of the total number of NEAs in this size range.

These data also provide the basis for producing a bias-corrected estimate for the total NEO population (Stuart and Binzel, 2004, Icarus 170, 295–311). We find 25 of the 26 Bus (1999, PhD thesis) taxonomic types are represented, with nearly 90\% of the objects falling within the broad S-, Q-, X-, and C-complexes. Rare A- and E-types are more common in the MC than NEO population (about 5\% compared to <1\%) and may be direct evidence of slow diffusion into MC orbits from the Flora and Hungaria regions, respectively. A possible family of MC objects (C-types) may reside at the edge of the 5:2 jovian resonance. Distinct signatures are revealed for the relative contributions of different taxonomic types to the NEO population through different source regions. E-types show an origin signature from the inner belt, C-types from the mid to outer belt, and P-types from the outer belt. S- and Q-types have effectively identical main-belt source region profiles, as would be expected if they have related origins. A lack of V-types among Mars-crossers suggests entry into NEO space via rapid transport through the $\nu$6 and 3:1 resonances from low eccentricity main-belt orbits, consistent with a Vesta origin. D-types show the strongest signature from Jupiter family comets (JFC), with a strong JFC component also seen among the X-types. A distinct taxonomic difference is found with respect to the jovian Tisserand parameter T, where C-, D-, and X-type (most likely low albedo P-class) objects predominate for T⩽3. These objects, which may be extinct comets, comprise 4\% of our observed sample, but their low albedos makes this magnitude limited fraction under-representative of the true value. With our taxonomy statistics providing a strong component to the diameter limited bias correction analysis of Stuart (2003, PhD thesis), we estimate 10–18\% of the NEO population above any given diameter may be extinct comets, taking into account asteroids scattered into T<3 orbits and comets scattered into T>3 orbits. In terms of possible space weathering effects, we see a size-dependent transition from ordinary chondrite-like (Q-type) objects to S-type asteroids over the size range of 0.1 to 5 km, where the transition is effectively complete at 5 km. A match between the average surface age of 5 km asteroids and the rate of space weathering could constrain models for both processes. However, space weathering may proceed at a very rapid rate compared with collisional timescales. In this case, the presence or absence of a regolith may be the determining factor for whether or not an object appears “space weathered.” Thus 0.1 to 5 km appears to be a critical size range for understanding the processes, timescales, and conditions under which a regolith conducive to space weathering is generated, retained, and refreshed.},

abstract = {Utilizing the largest available data sets for the observed taxonomic (Binzel et al., 2004, Icarus 170, 259–294) and albedo (Delbo et al., 2003, Icarus 166, 116–130) distributions of the near-Earth object population, we model the bias-corrected population. Diameter-limited fractional abundances of the taxonomic complexes are A-0.2\%; C-10\%, D-17\%, O-0.5\%, Q-14\%, R-0.1\%, S-22\%, U-0.4\%, V-1\%, X-34\%. In a diameter-limited sample, ∼30\% of the NEO population has jovian Tisserand parameter less than 3, where the D-types and X-types dominate. The large contribution from the X-types is surprising and highlights the need to better understand this group with more albedo measurements. Combining the C, D, and X complexes into a “dark” group and the others into a “bright” group yields a debiased dark-to-bright ratio of ∼1.6. Overall, the bias-corrected mean albedo for the NEO population is 0.14±0.02, for which an H magnitude of 17.8±0.1 translates to a diameter of 1 km, in close agreement with Morbidelli et al. (2002, Icarus 158 (2), 329–342). Coupling this bias corrected taxonomic and albedo model with the H magnitude dependent size distribution of (Stuart, 2001, Science 294, 1691–1693) yields a diameter distribution with 1090±180 NEOs with diameters larger than 1 km. As of 2004 June, the Spaceguard Survey has discovered 56\% of the NEOs larger than 1 km. Using our size distribution model, and orbital distribution of (Stuart, 2001, Science 294, 1691–1693) we calculate the frequency of impacts into the Earth and the Moon. Globally destructive collisions (∼1021 J) of asteroids 1 km or larger strike the Earth once every 0.60±0.1 Myr on average. Regionally destructive collisions with impact energy greater than 4×1018 J (∼200 m diameter) strike the Earth every 56,000±6000 yr. Collisions in the range of the Tunguska event (4–8×1016 J) occur every 2000–3000 yr. These values represent the average time between randomly spaced impacts; actual impacts could occur more or less closely spaced solely by chance. As a verification of these impact rates, the crater production function of Shoemaker et al. (1990, Geological Society of American Special Paper 247) has been updated by combining this new population model with a crater formation model to find that the observed crater production function on both the Earth and Moon agrees with the rate of crater production expected from the current population of NEOs.},

abstract = {We present the first redundant detection of sporadic impact flashes on the Moon from a systematic survey performed between 2001 and 2004. Our wide-field lunar monitoring allows us to estimate the impact rate of large meteoroids on the Moon as a function of the luminous energy received on Earth. It also shows that some historical well-documented mysterious lunar events fit in a clear impact context. Using these data and traditional values of the luminous efficiency for this kind of event we obtain that the impact rate on Earth of large meteoroids (0.1 10 m) would be at least one order of magnitude larger than currently thought. This discrepancy indicates that the luminous efficiency of the hypervelocity impacts is higher than 10‑2, much larger than the common belief, or the latest impact fluxes are somewhat too low, or, most likely, a combination of both. Our nominal analysis implies that on Earth, collisions of bodies with masses larger than 1 kg can be as frequent as 80,000 per year and blasts larger than 15-kton could be as frequent as one per year, but this is highly dependent on the exact choice of the luminous efficiency value. As a direct application of our results, we expect that the impact flash of the SMART-1 spacecraft should be detectable from Earth with medium-sized telescopes.},

abstract = {Reports of telescope observations of LTPs (Lunar Transient Phenomena) are as old as the telescope itself. Brightening or obscurations of large areas have been observed, and there have also been sporadic reports about long and short duration flashes. While long flashes may be the result of sun glint on the surface, short flashes (0.1-0.5s) most likely represent meteoroid impacts on the Lunar surface. Observations of the Lunar Seismic Network which recorded a total of 1700 impact events during the almost 8 years of operation, confirm that impacts on the Moon occur quite frequently. Obviously, it is more likely to capture a meteoroid impact during the prominent meteor showers, when the Lunar dark side faces the radiant of the incoming meteroids. Indeed, during the Leonid meteor shower of 1999 flashes from meteoroid impacts were observed and independently confirmed for the first time. Since then we have reports of other Leonids, or Perseids in 2004 and a possible Taurid in 2005. While the Leonids were reported at 3-6 mag the observed Perseid was reported at 9 mag. (For the Taurid no simultaneous observation is available) In order to obtain an improved statistics of the phenomenon, it is necessary to carry out systematic observation campaigns and to record more events. While previous observations relied on off-the-shelf video equipment, we propose a dedicated camera with higher sensitivity and real time detection, as for example the SPOSH camera, which is currently used to observe small meteors. The integrated DPU (Digital Processing Unit) samples and compares up to 8 frames per second and saves only those frames containing a flash event. These few frames are stored and/or can be transmitted with a low bandwidth connection. An appropriate telescope with high light-gathering power is required for the observations. Also, reliable predictions of shower activity are required. A break-through in studies of impact flashes may come, if an appropriate sensitive camera with a wide angle lens can be placed in Lunar orbit. From shorter range the camera can detect significantly more and smaller impacts than from Earth. The properties of very small Lunar impacts can improve our understanding of the current meteoritic flux in the solar system and give us insights in the risks involved for large habitats on the Moon's surface over a long period of time.},

Some present unknown parameters can be constrained in the future by monitoring impact flashes associated with meteoroid streams exhibiting a wide range of impact angles and energies. Here we further investigate some implications of the sporadic impact flashes detected so far and in particular we focus on whether the SMART-1 impact flash can give additional constraints on the luminous efficiency applicable to sporadic impacts, in order to derive more accurate impact rates on Earth. We have compared our derived impact fluxes with those obtained by Ceplecha (2001) and Brown et al. (2002) and we conclude that the present flux in the observed energy range would be underestimated. Finally, we conclude that the large lunar surface coverage and increasing sensitivity of modern video cameras makes this a powerful method to estimate terrestrial impact rates of large bodies that are statistically difficult to be detected from more limited atmospheric coverages characteristic of terrestrial networks.

abstract = {The first confirmed lunar impact flash due to a non-Leonid meteoroid is reported. The observed Perseid meteoroid impact occurred at 18h28m27s on August 11, 2004 (UT). The selenographic coordinates of the lunar impact flash are 48±1° N and 72±2° E, and the flash had a visual magnitude of ca. 9.5 with duration of about 1/30 s. The mass of the impactor is estimated to have been 12 g based on a nominal model with conversion efficiency from kinetic to optical energy of 2×10. Extrapolation of a power law size-frequency distribution fitting the sub-centimeter Perseid meteoric particles to large meteoroids suggests that several flashes should have been observed at this optical efficiency. The detection of only one flash may indicate that the optical efficiency for Perseid lunar impact is much lower, or that the slope of the size distribution differs between large meteoroids and typical sub-centimeter meteoric particles.},

We have evaluated the daily, seasonal, and annual changes in magnitude for our entire data set and have also calibrated the surface brightness of the entire lunar geography for several lunar phases by means of the observation of lunar eclipses. We find variations between +12 and +17 m V arcsec -2 with hourly changes upward of the order 0.25 m V arcsec -2 , which are uniquely due to the terrestrial meteorology. This rapid change in the terrestrial flux reaching the Moon is usually neglected when calibrating the magnitude of lunar impact events. We justify this using earthshine observations to determine the brightness for the day, time, and selenographic location of a given event in order to improve the accuracy of its brightness calibration up to 0.25 mag.},

abstract = {Meteoroid falls on the Moon produce transient luminous events usually named impact flashes. These emissions have been reported by several independent observers using ground-based telescopes over the last decade. We present here a compendium of these observations for the period 1999–2007, including apparent flash magnitudes, durations and the origin of the bolide (meteor shower or sporadic impact). Impact flashes appear on 1–10 camera frames corresponding to durations ranging from ∼10 ms to ∼1 s. The analysis of these data reveals a correlation between duration and intensity, with the exception of Leonid meteors. The difference between Leonids and other meteoroids are likely explained by the higher velocity of this swarm. For the other events, the observed trend implies that impact flash detections are at present limited by the frame rate which is generally equal or less than 60 frames par second (f/s). The durations of these transient events are typically longer than predictions based on expanding plasma-gas clouds. We thus argue that these luminous events correspond to radiation emitted by a cloud composed of gas and small ejected melt droplets. A simple model considering the black body radiation of cooling droplets provides a time scale commensurable with the observations. In addition, such modeling is useful for optimizing the specifications of monitoring equipment. In particular, the inferred range of effective temperatures implies that near-infrared observations would efficiently increase the number of detections, whereas multi-spectral observations are essential to progress in the understanding of the nature of these luminous events.},

abstract = {Monitoring the lunar surface for impacts is a highly rewarding approach to study small asteroids and large meteoroids encountering the Earth-Moon System. The various effects of meteoroids impacting the Moon are described and results from different detection and study techniques are compared. While the traditional statistics of impact craters allow us to determine the cumulative meteoroid flux on the lunar surface, the recent successful identification of fresh craters in orbital imagery has the potential to directly measure the cratering rate of today. Time-resolved recordings, e.g., seismic data of impacts and impact flash detections clearly demonstrate variations of the impact flux during the lunar day. From the temporal/spatial distribution of impact events, constraints can be obtained on the meteoroid approach trajectories and velocities. The current monitoring allows us to identify temporal clustering of impacts and to study the different meteoroid showers encountering the Earth-Moon system. Though observational biases and deficiencies in our knowledge of the scaling laws are severe, there appears to be an order-of-magnitude agreement in the observed flux within the error limits. Selenographic asymmetries in the impact flux (e.g., for equatorial vs. polar areas) have been predicted. An excess of impacts on the lunar leading hemisphere can be demonstrated in current data. We expect that future missions will allow simultaneous detections of seismic events and impact flashes. The known locations and times of the flashes will allow us to constrain the seismic solutions. While the numbers of flash detections are still limited, coordinated world-wide observations hold great potential for exploiting this observation technique. The potential for identification of fresh craters in high-resolution orbital image data has just barely been tapped, but should improve significantly with the LRO extended mission.},

Here we report the first visible observations of the LCROSS ejecta plume from Earth, thereby ascertaining the morphology of the plume to contain a minimum of two separate components, placing limits on ejecta velocities at multiple angles, and permitting an independent estimate of the illuminated ejecta mass. Our mass estimate implies that the lunar volatile inventory in the Cabeus permanently shadowed region includes a water concentration of 6.3±1.6\% by mass.},

@article{Halliday1996,
abstract = {We present data for 259 meteoric fireballs observed with the Canadian camera network, including velocities, heights, orbits, luminosities along each trail, estimates of preatmospheric masses and surviving meteorites (if any) as well as membership in meteor showers. Some 213 of the events comprise an unbiased sample of the 754 fireballs observed in a total of 1.51 × 1010 km2 h of clear-sky observations. The number of fireballs and the amount of clear sky in which they were recorded are given for each day of the year. We find at least 37\% of the unbiased sample are members of some 15 recognized meteor showers. Preatmospheric masses, based on an assumed luminous efficiency of 0.04 for velocities \&gt;10 km s-1, range from 1 g for some very fast fireballs up to hundreds of kilograms for the largest events. We present plots and equations for the flux, as a function of initial mass, for the entire group of fireballs and for some subgroups: meteorite-dropping objects; meteor shower members; groups that appear to be mainly of asteroidal or cometary origin; and for very fast objects. For masses of a few kilograms, asteroidal objects outnumber cometary ones. Cometary objects attain greater peak brightness than asteroidal ones of equal mass largely due to higher velocity, but also because they fragment more severely. For 66 fireballs, we estimate the meteoroid density using photometric and dynamic masses. Presumed cometary objects have typical densities near 1.0, while asteroidal values show two groups that suggest meteoroids similar to carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites. Our basic data may be used by others for further studies or to reexamine our results using assumptions different from those employed in this paper.},

Artificially induced impacts on airless near-Earth objects are now being used as a test bed to study a wide range of geomorphic phenomena. In this paper an analytical theory is used to predict the flash event that signals the initial phase of a surface impact. The model predicts the wave form, duration, and radiated energy content of the vapor plume starting only with the mass and kinetic energy of the impactor. The theory is applied to the planned 2009 LCROSS lunar impact where the impact flash event is predicted. The transient radiation emitted by the impact can be used to obtain some relevant impact parameters, and it is predicted to be energetic enough to possibly be captured by terrestrial observers.},

@article{Nemtchinov1998,
abstract = {The possibility of the remote sensing of the lunar surface and the determination of the flux of meteoroids impinging on the surface, by observations of light flashes due to impacts, is discussed. Data on the equation of state and optical properties are presented and compared for pure silica, lunar soil, granite-type rock, and H-chondrites. The results of two- and three-dimensional radiative-gasdynamic calculations are described for impacts at speeds of 15-30 km/s. Oblique impacts are shown to produce a high-speed jet directed along the surface. On the basis of the information on the lunar-surface relief, it is pointed out that the impact of such a jet on large stones and blocks as well as on the crater slope may result in the reflection of the high-speed jet and in the sharp increase of the luminous efficiency. Certain experiments on high-speed impacts as well as previously observed unsteady lunar phenomena are considered. Although the share of irradiated energy is not great (3 x 10\^{}-4-10\^{}-5 of the initial kinetic energy of the impactor), the flashes produced by the impacts of bodies of size 1-100 cm or larger can be recorded with an Earth-based meter telescope equipped with a high-sensitivity CCD matrix.},

@article{GORDON1921,
abstract = {THE reported failure of Prof. Goddard to obtain pecuniary support for his project to discharge a giant rocket at the moon leads me to ask a question which astronomers may answer. Why is it that no observer has ever reported the descent of a meteor upon the surface of our satellite? It seems reasonable to suppose that meteoric falls must occur there as upon the surface of the earth. According to the accepted estimate, the earth receives about 20,000,000 meteorites per diem. If that holds good, mutatis mutandis for the moon, our luminary must receive about 2,000,000 in twenty-four hours. The great majority of these would necessarily be invisible. One-half of the number would fall on her averted face. Of the remainder more would fall during sunlight than during the hours of darkness. Of those that fell during hours of darkness the greater number would be concealed by terrestrial cloud. Of those that were not so concealed one-half would fall on the illuminated part of the moon's disc, and, perhaps, be rendered invisible by the lunar brightness. It is easy to see that large abatements must therefore be made from the number of falls if we wish to estimate the probability of making a successful observation. This consideration has a bearing, by the way, on the reasonableness of expecting to be able to witness the arrival of Prof. Goddard's projected rocket if the aim were good and a hit secured; but that is by the way.},

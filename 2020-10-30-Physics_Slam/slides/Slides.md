## Mission: Find the Big Ones
::::::cols
::::col
- In 1998, NASA tasked with finding 90% of asteroids 1 km or larger
	- It is thought that we have met this now
- In 2005, NASA tasked with finding 90% of "dangerous" asteroids by 2020
	- Current estimates are than around 10% have been found
- How are these goals met without knowing how many are out there?

- Protection, Prevention, Prediction
- Better knowledge of meteoroid sizes leads to better protection
- If nothing else, allows to predict the lifetime of spacecraft before statistically getting struck

> "Construct of X size will likely last Y years before being hit by a rock of size Z or larger."

## Mission: Science!
<br>

- The number and sizes of the meteoroid population can give insight into the history of the Solar System
- A few options when rocks collide:
	- They could merge, making a larger rock
	- They smash one another apart, making more smaller rocks
	- Easy to replicate on a small scale by smashing...anything!
- The populations we observe can inform things like how old, dense, or energetic the Solar System has been in the past

## Observe: Movement

## Observe: Moon Smashing
<br><br>

::::::cols
::::col
- Many impacts too small to be directly observed
- Can only see them when they interact with something
- The Moon has no atmosphere, and thus meteoroids are free to smash into the surface, emitting a flash!

## Observe: Earth Smashing
- Can also observe meteoroids directly burning up in our atmosphere!

## Why I Enjoy: Nights {data-background-image='../images/NightSky.jpg'}
<br>

::::::cols
::::col
- I enjoy night-time observing
- Peaceful
- Feeling of be productive while the world sleeps
- Can practice some astrophotography

## Why I Enjoy: Flexibility
<br>

::::::cols
::::col

- Does not require elaborate setup or lab
- Fairly cheap
- Can be easily moved
- Software all open source and my own

## Why I Enjoy: Social Impact
<br>

- It is satisfying to work on something which is easy to see benefiting society
	- Either helping to identify or strategize about potentially hazardous asteroids
	- Or making future space travel and living a bit safer and feasible
- It is easy to describe and explain to non-scientists


## Conclusions
<br>

- Extra benefits of this research
	- Small engineering projects pop up enough to keep life interesting
	- Lots of Python programming practice for data processing and analysis
	- Experience using Linux systems, and remote accessing terminal based systems
- If you'd like to hear more and chat, don't hesitate to ask!
	- I'm not in my office as much as usual this semester, but am almost always in Discord or happy to chat via Zoom!
